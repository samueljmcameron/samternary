# samternary

`samternary` allows users to generate a ternary diagram, which is a visualisation useful for 3D data sets, where two of the dimensions are constrained an isoceles triangle.

For instance, consider a data set (x,y,z). For ternary diagrams to be useful, the domain D in the xy plane should be restricted to D:=\{x>0,y>0,x+y <= 1\}.

If user data has this property (or can be re-scaled to have this property), then this package could be useful.

See the examples folder for a list of examples on how to use this package.
